Depending on what version of Jenkins you are using, your Jenkins options may slightly vary.

You can check the Jenkins version from Jenkins Home page (localhost:8080), bottom right corner on your browser.

Configuring JDK
Try to locate JDK and look for JDK Installations button and click it

If you already see JDK Name followed by JAVA_HOME path, you are all set. But please ensure your java home directory is correct.  You can verify the the Java home using mvn --version command from your terminal. 

In certain cases, Maven will report JRE path as the JAVA_HOME, in case this
happens to be the case in your machine,you may want to provide the JAVA_HOME one level above the jre folder.

Configuring Maven
Try to locate Maven and look for Maven Installations button and click it

Generally the Maven path will be /usr/share/maven, however you can cross-check
what your mvn --version command reports as MAVEN_HOME.
