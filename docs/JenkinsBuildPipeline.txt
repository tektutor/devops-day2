Let's say you wish to create 3 pipeline stages for your Maven project.  Then you need to create 3 Jenkins jobs.

1. You first stage looks nothing different from regular Maven Job except that in the Add post-build action select "Archive the artifacts". Apply and Save your changes.

2. In the second stage, in Build Triggers section, you need to select Build after other projects are built and select the first stage project. In the post-build action select "Archive the artifacts". Save and Apply your changes. 

Repeat the step 2 for the stage 3 project ,except for one change i.e Build Triggers section you need to select Build after other project are build and select the second stage project. Save and Apply your changes.

3. Go back to Jenkins home page, on the right side where you see all the projects listed, try to locate the tab with "+" and click on it.

4. Select Build Pipeline View and type a view name as per your preference.

5. Select Initial Job -> Choose the Stage 1 Jenkins job and save and run the view.
